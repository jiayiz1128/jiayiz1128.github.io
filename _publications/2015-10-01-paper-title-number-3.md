**Abstract**
To address the issues of low sampling quality and efficiency in processing large-scale event logs in existing business process event log sampling methods, a new method, named VariantRank, is proposed, which is based on the importance of trace variants. First, the importance of each trace variant is calculated based on the activity importance and the importance of directly-follow relationships within the trace variants. Then, the trace variants are ranked according to their importance. Finally, based on the given sampling rate and the ranking of trace variants, the final sampling is performed to obtain the sample event logs. The effectiveness of the proposed sampling method is evaluated in terms of both sampling quality and sampling efficiency across 8 public event log datasets. The experimental analysis shows that, compared with the state-of-the-art sampling methods, VariantRank improves the sampling efficiency while ensuring the sampling quality.
